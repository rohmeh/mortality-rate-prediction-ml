# Prediction of Mortality Rate of Heart Failure Patients in ICU

This project is part of the Machine Learning Course (2023-02) which focuses on predicting the mortality rate of heart failure patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) using various Machine Learning models. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients early, enabling timely interventions.

## Overview

- Built a classification model to predict ICU mortality in heart failure patients.
- Utilized popular ML algorithms such as:
  - Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
  - AdaBoost

The dataset includes relevant patient features like age, blood pressure, creatinine levels, ejection fraction, and more.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-failure-mortality-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the directory:
   ```bash
   cd heart-failure-mortality-prediction
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python "ML Project Final.py"
   ```

> ⚠️ Note: Ensure the dataset file (if external) is present in the correct directory or update the path accordingly in the code.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn (optional, for visualization)
